.. data and metadata

What to save and organize
=========================

Raw data
--------

"Raw data" refer to **everything that you obtained during experiments**:

- Definition is difficult, but probably something like below:

     Any first-order experimental quality being acquired or generated
     with the use of a distinct method, and being stored to be analyzed later.
     (Sehara, 2019)

- In principle, any experimental quality that are acquired and stored by a program
  (including a human being) may be considered as "raw data":

  - Videos
  - Traces of physiological experiments
  - Annotated states of behavior or a behavioral task
  - etc.

.. caution::
   The data you obtained through *conversion or analysis* is normally
   **not** considered as the raw data (but there may be always some exceptions
   e.g. when your data uses a closed/proprietary format).

Metadata
--------

"Metadata" refer to **every parameter that you specified to obtain the data**, including:

- Information about animals e.g.:

  - species/strain/sex
  - date of birth, date of surgery, date of behavioral trainings/sessions
  - animal-specific experimental conditions

- Information about experimental conditions e.g.:

  - the type of the virus/drug(s) used
  - the protocol of viral/drug injection (method/area/type etc.)
  - the type and the algorithm of the behavioral task or the stimulation protocol
  - input resistance of the pipette

- Information about acquisition hardwares e.g.:

  - supplier, part number
  - filter/gain settings
