Why bother?
===========

Why does data organization matter?
----------------------------------

Without any agreed data organization:

- You may not find out what data is missing for which experiment:

  - Data tends to get dispersed over time, in different hard drives, in different computers.
  - You don't remember what type of acquisitions you exactly did several years ago, even when you want to make use of it.

- It takes time to understand the others' datasets:

  - People have their own preferred way of data organization and naming conventions.

What do I want to do?
---------------------

I want to build a common organization for data and metadata format, so that:

- You can make use of your data yourself several years later.
- You can make use of the others' data.
- You can possibly publish your dataset for the others to use.
